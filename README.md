Flow is an open source tool from Facebook that is "a static type checker, designed to find type errors in JavaScript programs". It supports adding types gradually to variables, parameters, return values, object properties, and array elements. Flow even catches some errors without adding types by using type inference and flow analysis.

Flow supports many types including primitives, functions (with specified signatures), arrays, objects, built-in classes, custom classes, and generic (parameterized) classes.

Flow is similar to Microsoft TypeScript and mostly uses the same syntax for specifying types. However, TypeScript is also a transpiler. One benefit of using Flow is that Babel can be used for transpiling. Babel typically implements new ECMAScript features before TypeScript.

This talk covers everything you need to know to get started using Flow, including integration with Babel, ESLint, editors, and IDEs.

## Is the facebook flow transpiler project still alive? 

The Flow type checker developed by Facebook (now Meta) is still an active project in 2024. However, its popularity and community activity have declined in comparison to TypeScript. Flow is still maintained and used internally by Meta for some of its projects, but the broader JavaScript/TypeScript community has largely gravitated towards TypeScript due to its comprehensive feature set, community support, and integration with the broader JavaScript ecosystem.
